This repository contains the code and instructions to deploy a sentiment analyzer using gradio


I have followed the following steps:

1. Data pre-processing: In data preprocessing, data cleaning occurs. To clean data: remove punctuations, convert the text to lowercase, remove stopwords, lemmatize or stem the text, and remove hyperlinks

2) Feature extraction. Convert the pre-processed text into numerical features that can be used to train a machine learning model. This has been done by using TF-IDF vectorizer.

3) Model training: Use a machine learning algorithm such as Naive Bayes, or Support Vector Machines (SVM) to train a sentiment analysis model. The model above has been trained using naive bayes algorithm.

4) Model evaluation: Test the accuracy of the model.

5) Deploy the model: Use the trained model to classify new text data in real-time.
